This is my first essay in the new system. I'm building this site from scratch, learning as I go, and documenting every step.

There's something powerful about **building in public** — not just showing the final product, but the messy middle. The typos, the refactors, the moments where you realize you've been thinking about a problem wrong.

## Why Write Here?

Because the internet needs more *spaces* and fewer *feeds*. 

A feed optimizes for engagement. A space optimizes for thought.

This is a space.

## Testing Images

Here's a default image:

Here's a full-bleed image:

And here's some text with a floated image. ![Float example](https://placehold.co/300x300/F5F5F5/2E7D32?text=Float+Left) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The image floats to the left and text wraps around it naturally. This demonstrates how float layouts work within the reading flow. Notice how the text respects the image boundary and creates a nice magazine-style layout.
